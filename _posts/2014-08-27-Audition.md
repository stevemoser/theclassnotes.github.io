Hello Cornellians!! If you are interested in auditioning for the Class Notes, here is the information you need to know!

We will be holding auditions on the following dates in the following locations:

* Tues 9/2 7-10 222 Robert Purcell Community Center
* Wed 9/3 7:30-9:30 222 RPCC
* Thurs 9/4 8-10 B08 Lincoln

We ask that you please prepare a short ~30 second solo to perform at your audition. That generally means you should sing a verse and a chorus of the song.

If you have any questions feel free to email gm@theclassnotes.com

Good Luck!
